Below are the steps to install E-tools.  Please follow the steps below
and contact support if you have any problems.

Step 1. Unpack the archive

Unix command
tar zxvf omnisupport.tar.gz
OR
Winzip
If you do not have access to tar, then you can use winzip. However,
if you use winzip then make sure before you unzip the program you go
to Option / Configuration / Miscellaneous and undo the option for
"Tar file smart CR / LF conversion"

Step 2. Change Permissions
cd myetools
chmod 666 lib/etools2.php

Step 3. Go to www.yourdomain.com/myetools/install.php

Fill out the form and hit submit
				    
Step 4. Change the permissions to make the software secure.
cd myetools
chmod 644 lib/etools.php

Step 5. Move ioncube
Move the ioncube folder to the root of where you have installed the

ioncube directory should be in this directory.

mv ioncube (location of your root directory)
